# Java Object Oriented Programming

The object oriented programming has the objective to define the real world things as objects. Let's see it in detail:

### Object and Classes

An **object** has *state* (properties), *behavior* (methods) and *identity* (used by the JVM). A **class** is a template for objects, so an object an instance of a given class. A class can contain:

* Properties
* Methods
* Constructors
* Blocks
* Nested class and interface
